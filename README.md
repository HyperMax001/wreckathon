# 💩 Just Clap – Professional Poop Cleaning Service (Parody) 🚽

Welcome to **Just Clap** – the internet’s first (and hopefully last) **Professional Poop Cleaning SaaS Platform™**.  
Because why solve real problems when you can solve the ones nobody asked for?  

Built with ❤️ for **Wreckathon**, where absurdity meets code.

## 🌟 Features That Nobody Wanted

- **Funny Signup & Onboarding**
  - Answer *deeply personal* and *completely unnecessary* questions like:
    - “How many times do you poop in a day?”  
    - “What’s your usual poop color?”  
  - Real keyboards? **Too mainstream.**  
    We give you fake keyboards that make you cry while typing.  

- **Interactive Poop-Cleaning Simulation**
  - To unlock the platform, you must first **help an animated character**:
    - Pull down their pants (don’t worry, it’s cartoonish… hopefully).  
    - Scrub the poop away with your mouse like a true hero.  
  - Only then will you be deemed worthy of our *sacred poop-cleaning services*.  

- **Completely Useless, Totally Absurd**
  - Perfectly mocks the seriousness of “real” SaaS apps.  
  - This project will never raise VC funding (unless the investors are *really* weird).

- **Animations:** Over-the-top CSS/JS sorcery  
- **Backend:** Who needs one? The poop cleans itself.
